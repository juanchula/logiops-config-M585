# Logiops ettings for Logitech M585

This is my personal **[logiops](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops)** config file for a Logitech M585


Button | Press | Gesture Up | Gesture Down | Gesture Left | Gesture Right
-|-|-|-|-|-
Back | Play/Pause | Scroll Up | Scroll Down | Previus Song/Video | Next Song/Video

Scroll slide left | Back | - | - | Brightness - |  Brightness +
Scroll slide right | Forward | - | - | Volume - | Volume +


To consider:
* I don't know if it works on Logitech M590
* I tested them on Manjaro KDE but the behavior should not vary on another distro / desktop (except \*)
* Use at your own risk
